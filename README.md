# PasswordEntropyCalculator

I set myself the following additional goal (devised by me):

Through researching about password security, I had learnt about the bits of entropy a password has; it is a measure of how many combinations there exists for a password of the same length and same pool of characters (lower case, upper case, numbers and special characters for example). The higher the entropy, the more secure a password is because there are more combinations an adversary needs to try.

I decided to write a program to estimate the bits of entropy a user's password has. While I have not programmed in C++ before, I have some understanding of programming and object oriented design so I modified my program to have a function in a separate file. Furthermore, I wanted to train myself to be a professional software developer/engineer by adding code documentation, an open source license and using Git. The git repository can be found here: https://github.com/GavinChoy/PasswordEntropyCalculator

My solution was in two files called EntropyCalc.cc and calc-helper.cc
